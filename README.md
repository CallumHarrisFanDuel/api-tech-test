# Fanduel API Tech Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Fanduel Technical Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun and interesting. There are no trick questions.

## The Brief

### Introduction

Our product team would like you to help us build a new [roulette][1] platform. Currently all the different variations of
roulette work in different ways, some with more business logic in the front end than is preferred. The product team
aspire to have a single roulette platform which they can concentrate their focus on.

For this technical test we have a partially created roulette API. This is an API that receives requests from a user, 
simulates a game of roulette, and returns the results. A front end user interface is not required, neither is any 
consideration of any services which you might expect to be shared; examples of these might be account verification of
game history.

### What to expect

- Implement the unfinished method to return the correct response. You will be have to look through the code to determine
the best way to calculate the amount won once the api has been called.
- Review a portion of the code and highlight issues found in the RedBlackBet class.
- Fix broken and implement missing unit tests.
- Discussions and questions based on the code in the project on how specific features could be implemeneted.

Weâ€™d like you to consider:

- 
- Testing and maintainability - you should consider what testing is appropriate.

### Further considerations
